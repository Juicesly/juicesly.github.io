  <p>
    I didn’t fall in love with games because of perfect endings or cinematic moments, it happened in the middle of shared experiences, late nights, unfinished runs, and spaces that felt bigger than the screen they were on.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the first games that made me feel this was Destiny, not because it was flawless,
    but because it felt like somewhere you could exist. You weren’t just completing
    objectives, you were inhabiting a world, moving through it with other people,
    learning how to read situations, how to adapt, how to be present. Those spaces
    stayed with me, even when I wasn’t playing. That feeling, of being somewhere else, of wanting to stay inside a space just a
    little longer, is what pulled me toward making games.
  </p>

  
    
  

  <p>
    As a digital artist and game designer, I’m drawn to 3D worlds because they let me step into environments that feel real in their own way. I love the sense of scale, the atmosphere, the quiet moments between actions, the feeling that I’m not just looking at a scene but actually inside it. When a space is done right, it feels alive, and I find myself wanting to explore it, to understand it, to exist there for a while.
  </p>

  <p>
    Creating games feels like a way to share that feeling with other people. I don’t just want players to see what I’ve made, I want them to feel like they’re standing in it, moving through it, discovering it at their own pace. Whether I’m working with 3D environments, interaction design, or visual systems, I’m always thinking about what it feels like to be in the world I’m building.
  </p>
  <p>
    Making games has also taught me patience. Building something interactive is rarely smooth, ideas change, systems break, and progress can be slow. But even when things don’t work the first time, I still want to keep going, to adjust, rebuild, and try again. That process, as frustrating as it can be, is part of what makes the work meaningful to me.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of the day, I make games because I love spaces that feel lived in, places
    that invite curiosity and presence. If I can create worlds that make someone feel
    the way I do when I step into a game I care about, then I know I’m doing something right.
